# Good Standing

Simple World of Warcraft addon that displays faction changes in the chat window and keeps track of gains per session.

This addon was written as a test addon for a more extensive reputation tracking addon, but for the moment it does exactly what I need it to do, so I am not planning to add any new freatures now.

Compatible with Battle for Azeroth.
